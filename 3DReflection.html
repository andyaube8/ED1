  <h1>Matchbox Car Relpication - 3D Printing </h1>
  <p><i>This project for E&D 1 was to create a 3D model of a matchbox car. We used engineering drawings and modeled the design using OnShape to create the model for our design. We then 3D printed it and compared it to the initial matchbox car. This is how I did it. </i></p>

  <div class='modelo-wrapper'> <div style="width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative"> <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;"> <iframe src="https://app.modelo.io/embedded/_M4J25OOdD?viewport=true&autoplay=true&autoRotate=true&hideTools=false" style="width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen allowfullscreen ></iframe> </div> </div> </div>


  <h3>Project Steps </h3>
  <p>Engineering Drawing </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Choose the matchbox car to replicate </li>
  <li>Using the calipers, measure all sides of the car </li>
  <li>Draw the 3 viewpoints of the car along with a 3/4 view for reference </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Capture/Archive </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Take pictures of each step of the process </li>
  <li>Upload pictures and files to GitHub </li>
  </ul>

  <p>OnShape </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Transfer engineering drawing into OnShape and scale it </li>
  <li>Create the drawing profile from the 3D envelope </li>
  <li>Remove all the negative space from the car </li>
  <li>Add in the fillets and extrusions to the wheels </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Prepare and Slice File </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Create a CAD Drawing of the model </li>
  <li>Prepare to slice the file in Cura </li>
  </ul>

  <p>3D Print </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Using the model from Cura, print the car </li>
  <li>Compare to initial matchbox car </li>
  <li>Upload pictures to the slidedeck </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Github Archive </h3>
  <p>After completing my design, I uploaded each iteration and the final design on Github. You can find the repository for this project here: https://github.com/andyaube8/ED1/tree/master/3D%20Extrusion%20Car </p>

  <h3>Setbacks and Challanges </h3>
  <p>One setback I faced during this project was trying to add designs and details to the sides and wheels of my car. I made the mistake of using 3 point arcs instead of straight lines to create the car because I thought it looked a litte more realistic. Little did I know, you need a flat plane to create a design on or do any types of extrusions. Trying to figure this out and ultimately failing took a lot of time away from my work. A challange I faced was trying to get the dimensions and proportions of my car to fit with the matchbox xar I chose. No matter what I tried, the car was always too short and too wide which threw off all my percent error calculations. </p>

  <h3>Solutions </h3>
  <p>Instead of continuing to hopelessly attempt to create a design on the parts of the car that were not a flat plane, I decided to focus my attention on what I could design on. I made the top of the car as close to the car as possible, and I added fillets and designs to the rest of the car where I could. If I couldn't control how certain sides of the car looked, I still wanted what I could control to look as good as possible. With regards to the scaling of my car compared to the initail version, I could not find a way to have the proportions match. I thought that if I lined everything up correctly compared to the other sides, it wouldn't matter how short it was because that could all be fixed later. Spoiler alert, I was wrong, and this was one problem I couldn't fix with any reative solution or reworking. </p>
